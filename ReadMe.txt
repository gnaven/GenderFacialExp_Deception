Here we analyze the differences in facial expressions during deceptive 
behaivour from Gender. Different smile types were also found to be 
indicators of deceptive behaivour. These smiles were also analyzed with 
respect to gender. 
Finally we tried to predict the if people are decieving or not from 
smile types/ AUs differences in Gender.

**Data**
Not added here. This uses clustered data on smile types from AUs (output from OpenFace) that runs through CHEESE, framework that clusters combinations of AU06 and AU12 to five different smile type clusters (from k-means and Beta-Mixture 5) and 9 different clusters (beta-mixture model 9)
